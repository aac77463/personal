\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.2}{\ignorespaces Effect of dust-to-gas ratio on the shape of planetary gaps. Snapshots are taken at 100 disk orbits for all cases. The top panel shows the gas gap shapes for different initial dust-to-gas ratios, for a Jupiter mass planet. The bottom panel shows the local dust-to-gas ratios. In the upper panel the black line shows a dustless model. As dust-to-gas ratio increases, the pressure bump in the inner gap-edge becomes suppressed, and the bump in the outer gap-edge is nearly washed out. Inspecting the lower plots, the deviation from the dustless case happens when the local dust-to-gas ratio approaches unity. This is expected, as the backreaction of the dragforce comes to heavily influence the gas motion. This threshold is easily reached in the pressure bumps of the planetary gap edges for the runs with initially high dust-to-gas ratios. Given enough time, disks with $\varepsilon =10^{-2}$ (and lower) will reach unity, if the disk is large enough and the pebbles drift continously. The particle drift is enhanced by the planeraty gap and a global negative pressure gradient.\relax }}{12}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.3}{\ignorespaces Same as 2.2\hbox {} but for $q=10^{-4}$. A high dust-to-gas ratio again causes the shape of the gap to deviate from the dustless case. The two highest dust to gas ratios are affected as well as the $\varepsilon =0.001$ case. The effect of the inner bump anticorrelate with the Jupiter case, this is explained in \textbf {INSERT SECTION HERE}.\relax }}{12}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.4}{\ignorespaces The effect of the particle drift and angular momentum conservation in the gap profile of a Neptune-mass planet. The red lines show runs with $\varepsilon =1$. The black lines show runs with $\varepsilon =0.1$. Solid lines have $b=1 $ ($b$ is the power law of the temperature, giving a global negative pressure gradient); the dashed lines are control runs that correspond to $b=0$, with no global negative pressure. The control runs are similar, with the higher-dust to gas ratio showing a small depression. However, when drift is included, to conserve angular momentum the gas is pushed outwards. For higher dust-to-gas ratios (solid red line), more gas is pushed outwards than for lower dust-to-gas ratio (black solid line).\relax }}{14}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.5}{\ignorespaces Two dimensional visualization of the effect of dust-to-gas ratio in Fig.\nobreakspace {}2.3\hbox {} \& Fig.\nobreakspace {}2.2\hbox {}. The plots show the gas density for a disk with planet mass ratio $q=10^{-3}$ (Top) and $q=10^{-4}$ (Bottom), with dust-to gas ratios ($\varepsilon =10{-2}, 10^{-1}, 1$) increasing towards the right. For $\varepsilon =10^{-2}$, the dust concentration remains low and the gas is unaffected, with the spiral and gap edges remaining mostly smooth as in the dustless case in Fig.\nobreakspace {}2.1\hbox {}. However, for $\varepsilon =0.1$, the effect is visible at the gap edges and the spiral as they become less laminar and more turbulent-like. In the $\varepsilon =1$ case, the spiral breaks up into eddies, similar to the behavior of cigarette smoke.\relax }}{15}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.6}{\ignorespaces Dust (upper panels) and gas (lower panels) in a disk with initial dust-to-gas ratio $\varepsilon =10^{-1}$. The top row shows results for a disk with a planet of mass ratio $q=10^{-3}$ and the bottom row shows results for mass ratio $q=10^{-4}$. The first column shows the effect of planet with no photoelectric heating. The middle column, labeled ``PEI'', shows the effect of the photoelectric instability on its own. The last column shows the combined effect of photoelectric instability and a planet. The most striking feature of this comparison is that the $q=10^{-4}$ planet with PEI is virtually indistinguishable from the PEI alone (the middle case). The main feature that makes the $q=10^{-3}$ distinguishable in the midst of PEI structures is the deep and clear planetary gap. We conclude that when photoelectric heating is included, we find that the photoelectric instability obscures structures induced by planets unless the planet's mass is sufficiently large to carve a noticeable gap. The plots are shown after 100 planetary orbits.\relax }}{17}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.7}{\ignorespaces Azimuthal average of the dust density for the simulations shown in 2.6\hbox {}. The left plot shows the $q=10^{-3}$ case, the right plot shows the $q=10^{-4}$ case. The cases of planet only (red line) and planet + instability (black line) both have a large gap in the dust, centered at $r=1$, where the planet is located. The pure PEI case (blue line) shows structure inside the predicted location of the gap. The lower mass planet also carves a dust gap, but the pure instability and combined case coincide almost exactly. The planet cannot easily be disentangled from the instability in this case.\relax }}{18}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.8}{\ignorespaces Dust (upper panels) and gas (lower panels) for a disk with dust-to-gas ratio of unity. The disk aspect ratio is $h=0.05$. With the increased dust-to-gas ratio (and stronger effect of the drag force backreaction), the planet-only case shows increased turbulent-like behavior, and the wake has the appearance of cigarette smoke. The middle panels shows a simulation with PEI only. With more dust, the structures are different than in Fig.\nobreakspace {}2.6\hbox {}, which is to be expected, given more photoelectric heating and more backreaction. In the combined case (right panels), the plots suggest that the simulation with the higher mass planet is more depleted in grains than the simulation with the lower mass planet. We quantify this result in Fig.\nobreakspace {}2.9\hbox {}. In the gas plots (lower panels) the spiral wake of the higher mass planet is visible.\relax }}{20}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.9}{\ignorespaces Same as Fig.\nobreakspace {}2.7\hbox {} but for $\varepsilon =1$. The simulations with the Jupiter-mass planet case shows a discernable gap that breaks the repeating pattern of the photoelectric instability. {\it This is the key to distinguishing a planet in a disk with photoelectric instability.} The gap size $\delta r_{\rm gap}$ must be larger than the wavelength of the instability $\lambda _{\rm PEI}$. For the Neptune case, the planet carves a much narrower gap, which almost coincides with the periodicity of the instability, making the identification of a planet more challenging.\relax }}{21}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.10}{\ignorespaces A comparison for the effect with and without backreaction for two dust-to-gas ratios. The two ratios are \ $\varepsilon =0.1$ and $10^{-2}$. The case with lower dust-to-gas ratio does not yield enough photoelectric heating t\ o form structures, so the effect of the backreaction being turned off does not change the results.\relax }}{21}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.11}{\ignorespaces A comparison with backreaction active and inactive for a disk of $\varepsilon =10^{-1}$ and $h=0.05$. We see that the backreaction confines the dust into shapely and organized structures.\relax }}{22}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.12}{\ignorespaces Same as 2.8\hbox {}, but for $h=0.1$. For the dust plots we see the typical clearing out of dust, with the Jupiter mass carving a larger gap. The instability case now shows only a few arcs and one large diameter ring on the outer edges of the disk. The combined case shows the large disk at the outer boundaries with some added features. Again the Jupiter-mass planet pushes grains away from its gap; and the Neptune-mass planet does not generate structures easily distinguishable from the PEI alone. With this higher temperature, the Neptune-mass planet does not carve a partial gap in the gas, as expected from its lower thermal mass. Run L shows an asymmetry in the outer edge of the dust distribution. The gas plot reveals that these asymmetries are caused by vortices, in a prominent $m=3$ mode. These vortices were generated by Rossby wave instability, effected by the backreaction of the dragforce as the dust front drifts inwards.\relax }}{25}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.13}{\ignorespaces Similar to Fig.\nobreakspace {}\G@refundefinedtrue \text {\normalfont \bfseries ??}\GenericWarning { }{LaTeX Warning: Reference `fig:eps10dustgas' on page 28 undefined}, but for $h=0.2$. In this hot disk, neither of the planets is massive en\ ough to carve a deep gas gap. For the Jupiter case a gap is carved in the dust, but for the Neptune case the dust streams past the planet's orbit (left plots). This is because in this hot disk the drift time past the planet's corotational region is faster than a planetary orbit. For the Neptune case, these times are comparable (see Sect.\nobreakspace {}\G@refundefinedtrue \text {\normalfont \bfseries ??}\GenericWarning { }{LaTeX Warning: Reference `sect:eps1h02' on page 28 undefined}) and the dust can stream past the planet. The Jupiter-mass planet, with a larger corotational region, will be able to scatter the grains and carve a deep dust gap. The combined effect of a planet and the instability is barely distinguishable from purely PEI in this hotter disk, mostly because a gap is not carved and most of the dust has rapidly drifted inwards.\relax }}{28}
